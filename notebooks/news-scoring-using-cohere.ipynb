Famous economist Dr. Roerofubota said yesterday. In the announcement of the Afrimat Construction Index (ACI), and on behalf of Afrimat, he said ACI reached 110.3 points in the second half of 2021 and reached a 55% rebound compared to the same quarter last year. .. The construction industry continues to improve, he said in a telephone interview. Quarterly improvements were driven by a significant increase in employment in the construction sector and sales of building materials. Since the second quarter of 2020, the construction industry has created approximately 156,000 jobs. Bota said other promising improvements in the building blocks are the value of the building plans passed and the value of the buildings completed by the larger municipalities of the country. “Unfortunately, the post-pandemic construction recovery remains incomplete, with the second quarter 6.8% behind Covid, the same quarter of 2019.” But Bota said he was confident that it would continue. Damage to buildings from July riots and looting, and potential additional spending on buildings, repairs and security in KwaZulu-Natal and Houten could boost construction activity in the third and perhaps fourth quarters He said it was highly sexual. .. Inflation has begun to fall in recent months, well below the South African Reserve Bank’s upper inflation target. This means that interest rates may remain low until 2022. “A 30% reduction in the cost of mortgages at prime rates has already helped us to return to higher home prices and increase the value of new mortgages,” he said. In addition, two business confidences recorded an immediate recovery from the decline following the July unrest. According to Bota, several companies that have a strong foothold in the construction sector’s value chain have recently released impressive financial results. Examples include JSE-listed Cashbuild and Murray & Roberts, which show that purchase orders have reached a new record of R60.7 billion. “But now all eyes will focus on the government’s reconstruction and reconstruction plans. It’s far behind the starting block.” He hopes that further relaxation of blockade regulations and tax jackpots against the backdrop of record mining sector interests will contribute to the faster implementation of this plan.

Famous economist Dr. Roerofubota said yesterday. In the announcement of the Afrimat Construction Index (ACI), and on behalf of Afrimat, he said ACI reached 110.3 points in the second half of 2021 and reached a 55% rebound compared to the same quarter last year. .. The construction industry continues to improve, he said in a telephone interview. Quarterly improvements were driven by a significant increase in employment in the construction sector and sales of building materials. Since the second quarter of 2020, the construction industry has created approximately 156,000 jobs. Bota said other promising improvements in the building blocks are the value of the building plans passed and the value of the buildings completed by the larger municipalities of the country. “Unfortunately, the post-pandemic construction recovery remains incomplete, with the second quarter 6.8% behind Covid, the same quarter of 2019.” But Bota said he was confident that it would continue. Damage to buildings from July riots and looting, and potential additional spending on buildings, repairs and security in KwaZulu-Natal and Houten could boost construction activity in the third and perhaps fourth quarters He said it was highly sexual. .. Inflation has begun to fall in recent months, well below the South African Reserve Bank’s upper inflation target. This means that interest rates may remain low until 2022. “A 30% reduction in the cost of mortgages at prime rates has already helped us to return to higher home prices and increase the value of new mortgages,” he said. In addition, two business confidences recorded an immediate recovery from the decline following the July unrest. According to Bota, several companies that have a strong foothold in the construction sector’s value chain have recently released impressive financial results. Examples include JSE-listed Cashbuild and Murray & Roberts, which show that purchase orders have reached a new record of R60.7 billion. “But now all eyes will focus on the government’s reconstruction and reconstruction plans. It’s far behind the starting block.” He hopes that further relaxation of blockade regulations and tax jackpots against the backdrop of record mining sector interests will contribute to the faster implementation of this plan. Andries van Heerden, CEO of Afrimat, is slowly but feeling positive economic momentum within the group to accelerate the long-awaited infrastructure project ready to run the business. He said he needed momentum and commitment from the government.
